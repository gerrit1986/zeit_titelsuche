## What's this? ##
It's a simple search interface for [ZEIT ONLINE](http://zeit.de).

## What does it do? ##
It searches headings of ZEIT articles and returns all hits in descending order by date (most recent on top).

## How does it work? ##
It was created using [Django](http://djangoproject.com) and [ZEIT ONLINE Content API](http://developer.zeit.de/index/).

## What's next? ##
* Short summaries should be displayed
* Summaries and full text should be searchable
* The following search operators should work: (`""`; `*`; `NOT`; `AND`; `OR`; `XOR`)
* Basic concept disambiguation
